A voting system with Atmega32 
# Introduction
This project is a safe digital voting system using atmega32. It is meant to ease the process of voting and counting votes in a safe protected way. On a big scale, every region has its device in which ids of all voters living there plus the id of a master who can see the result is added to the device’s memory so everyone must first authenticate. When the deadline for voting comes, the master stops the process. In this step, the result of the voting is encrypted using the symmetric key method so it can’t be hacked while it is sent to the central processor via the internet by the master. More details of the software and also the hardware are also included below.
